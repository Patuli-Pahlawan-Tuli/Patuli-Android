    Patuli (Pahlawan Tuli) is an application designed to serve as a platform for learning and practicing Bisindo sign language. Our aim is to help users who are interested in learning sign language to develop a better understanding and eventually communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing community. 
   
    We hope that our application will empower users to connect with and support individuals with hearing impairments.
